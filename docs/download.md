### Beta track (Closed track)

You can become a beta tester for the app to help me find bugs in the app. This will allow you to use new features and test them before they are available for everyone on the play store. This will help me catch bugs and get feedback on new features early and will support the development.

**Become a beta tester using [this](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.kevalpatel2106.pocketci) link.** Once you're a beta tester, you will start receiving beta versions through Play Store automatically.

### Internal track

These builds are published for every commit on the `main` branch. So these builds are bleeding edge and may be unstable. So, use them at your own risk. This track is only **recommended for developers actively working on this project**.
